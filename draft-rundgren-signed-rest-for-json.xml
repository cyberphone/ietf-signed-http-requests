        This specification describes how JCS <xref target="JCS"/>
        combined with JWS <xref target="RFC7515"/>,
        can be utilized to support HTTP <xref target="RFC7231"/> based REST <xref target="REST"/> applications
        needing digitally signed requests.
        The described scheme is tailored for Web applications
        using JSON <xref target="RFC8259"/> as message format.
        In addition, there is a specific variant for requests that
        do not have a HTTP body like GET.
      </t>
      <t>
        The intended audiences of this document are Web tool vendors, as
        well as designers of secure Web applications.

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        Currently there is no standard for digitally signing REST <xref target="REST"/>
        requests.  This has lead to the development of several proprietary solutions (see <xref target="other.solutions"/>)
        typically building on using HTTP header data for holding security constructs,
        while JSON request data is provided in clear in the HTTP body.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification is intended to provide a standardized alternative that
        fully honors the REST concept without (directly) using HTTP headers for holding
        security constructs.  That is, JSON message data is supposed to also hold
        the security portion of a message.  This arrangement has the following characteristics:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Since REST requests (as a minimum) also are defined by the HTTP URI and HTTP Verb
            these attributes are added as reserved JSON properties to the signed request data.
          </t>
          <t>
            Due to the fact that messages compliant with this specification constitute of self-contained JSON objects,
            they may be serialized in databases or be embedded in other JSON objects.  The latter includes
            supporting counter signatures.
          </t>
          <t>
            The use of canonicalization provided by JCS makes signatures remain valid
            also after being processed by arbitrary JSON compliant tools.
          </t>
          <t>
            JWS is used in detached mode without modifications or extensions. 
          </t>
          <t>
            For general interoperability concerns as well as due to the relyiance on JCS,
            JSON message data is limitied to the I&nbhy;JSON <xref target="RFC7493"/> subset. 
          </t>
        </list>
        The above applies to REST requests using the HTTP methods POST, PUT or PATCH described in <xref target="rest.operation.withbody"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        For REST requests using the HTTP methods GET or DELETE, another entirely URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> based
        scheme is described in <xref target="rest.operation.urionly"/>.
